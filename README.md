## Description

This web application is designed to help new dads find meaningful ways to engage their child based on age and current developmental phase. The app works in tandem with the [Dad Helper API](https://github.com/maxobaxo/dad-helper-api), which communicates with a mongoDB database at [mLab.com](https://www.mLab.com).

_*Current version of this app is deployed via heroku at [Dad-Helper](https://dad-helper.herokuapp.com/)*_
